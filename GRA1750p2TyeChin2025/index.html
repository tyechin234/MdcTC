      <h3> Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Grease 2 large cookie sheets or line with Silpat or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Add the brown sugar and white sugar and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Mix the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in medium bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the butter-sugar mixture. Stir in the raisins and nuts. Stir in the oats</li>
        <li>Spoon out the dough by large tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie.</li>
        <li>Bake until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. If baking 2 cookie sheets at once, swap their positions on the racks mid-bake.</li>
        <li>Cool 1 minute on the cookie sheets. Then carefully remove them, using a metal spatula, to a wire rack. Cool completely. They will be quite soft until completely cooled. Store tightly covered at room temperature for up to 5 days.</li>
